# Extreme-Learning-Machines (ELMs)

UCL COMP0197: Applied Deep Learning coursework

This task uses the same data set in the [Image Classification tutorial](https://github.com/YipengHu/COMP0197/tree/main/tutorials/img_cls), and to experiment a different type of neural networks, the extreme learning machines (ELMs).

This coursework does not focus on model accuracy, but rather on experiencing different regularisation methods, for training the ELMs such as mixup algorithm and model ensemble.
